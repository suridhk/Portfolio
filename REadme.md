# Introduction to Programming – Coursework Portfolio

This repository archives all academic work completed during the **Introduction to Programming** module. It serves as a record of my progressive development in **Python**, spanning foundational theory, weekly coding challenges, and comprehensive final projects.

---

##  Repository Structure

The repository is organized into three core sections:

### 1. Weekly Exercise Documents
A collection of Word documents focusing on programming theory and logic-based questions.
* **Coverage:** Weeks 1 through 8 (excluding Week 3).

### 2. Weekly Python Programs
A library of Python scripts developed to master specific programming milestones:
* **Weeks 1-2:** Basic syntax and initial task implementation.
* **Week 3 (Control Flow):** Deep dive into Boolean logic, loops (`for`/`while`), conditional statements (`if`/`elif`/`else`), and membership testing.
* **Week 4 (Functions):** Implementation of user-defined functions and `lambda` expressions.
* **Weeks 5-8:** Consolidated scripts for advanced weekly practice.

### 3. Final Assignment Projects

#### Beckett Pizza Plaza
A commercial logic script designed to handle a **"4-for-3" promotion**.
* **Key Features:** Validates numeric input, identifies the cheapest item via `min()`, and calculates the final discounted total.
* **Concepts:** Lists, input validation, and mathematical operations.

####  Password Security Check
A security simulation mimicking **partial-password authentication** used in banking systems.
* **Key Features:** Checks password length requirements and requests specific characters based on random indexing.
* **Concepts:** String manipulation, `random` library, and program termination logic.
